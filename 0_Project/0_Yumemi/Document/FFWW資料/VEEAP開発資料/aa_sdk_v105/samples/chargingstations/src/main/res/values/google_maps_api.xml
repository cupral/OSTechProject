    TODO: Before you run your application, you need a Google Maps API key.

    First you need to find the SHA-1 fingerprint for your app signing certificate.
    To do that, follow the directions here:
    https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/android-api/signup#getting-the-certificate-information-yourself

    Then you can get a Google Maps API key for that certificate by following the directions here:
    https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/android-api/signup#key-std-details

    When you follow the directions to create the Google Maps API key, use this package name:
    com.google.android.apps.auto.sdk.samples.chargingstations

    Once you have your key (it starts with "AIza"), replace the value for "google_maps_key" below.

    <string name="google_maps_key" translatable="false">YOUR_KEY_HERE</string>
